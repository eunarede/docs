## Creating a container for WHMCS

Often you will need additional containers in your account. For instance, we recommend to add another container for WHMCS. To add an additional container to an account:
1. In Google Tag Manager, select an account. The default workspace for the selected container appears.
2. Click **Admin** in the top nav bar.
3. From the **Containers** dropdown menu, choose **Create Containerâ€¦**
4. Enter a container name when prompted. Select if you will use the container for Web, iOS, or Android, choose between Firebase (recommended) or Legacy, and click **Create**.
